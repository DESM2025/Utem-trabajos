It makes it super easy to break away from the monitors and immediately disconnect from work after clocking out. 

The shelving organization has been an on going struggle. At first I had it in alphabetical and hated it. Series chaotically bled from shelf to shelf and it just didn‚Äôt look cohesive. Separated the BL out and claimed the spaces as Non-BL and BL ü§£ The Non-BL is mostly kinda *ish* in alphabetical order while trying to keep same series on the same shelf. The BL is by publisher, then size, then alphabetical *ish* mostly *ish*

The last couple pictures are the rulers of the house and home. Solar and Scarlet. They love curling up, cuddling, snoring and farting the day away while I usually have my nose stuck in a book.

1ggk1gg,This is how I keep my manga,2024-10-31 14:28:30,cantspeakcoherently,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ggk1gg,86,"Due to all the storage questions, I wanted to show how I personally keep my manga to preserve them. No, I don't use gloves or such to read, just basic cleanliness guidelines - wash your hands before, don't touch your face while reading, no food or drinks - basic stuff for anything you don't want to have degrade quickly.

This is a tool cabinet with a lock, I recommend getting one new so you don't have to deal with grease and grime from tools themselves, no rust, etc. Having doors is great as it limits the dust that can get to your books.

On the back and side there is a shelf-liner, mostly to hold the styrofoam in the back as there would otherwise be a spine to the back panels which could damage your books. The styrofoam that came with the cabinet fit perfectly. Then I have some 1/16"" acid-free foam panels that separate the books and cabinets. This way any heat the cabinet walls have does not pass to the books and the foam acts as a temperature barrier. This also prevents the glossy covers from sticking to the metal walls.

The cabinet is by a window, yes. But the curtain rod has a wrap around (most do) so I have the curtain tucked around so no sunlight can hit the cabinet. If I had the space elsewhere, I would move it away from the window entirely and recommend anyone doing the same thing so you don't turn it into an oven.

A lock is great because if you have friends/family they can't get their grubby hands on your books and damage them in any way without your expressed permission. I myself gave a 4 and 7 year old I don't want them getting to the books both for the protection of the books, but also the contents as a lot of these are not kid appropriate.

The shelves are deep enough that I can stack two rows of books, which I have done here. I recommend starting from the ground up so you don't have a tip-hazard. I personally don't like anchors, but you can use wedges in the front if you wish, putting heavy books on the bottom helps keep from being top-heavy and tipping. At the moment I have some old anime/manga drawing books at the bottom to help with weight, but will move them out as I fill the shelves.

I just wanted to show how I personally handle book storage so others that are expanding their collection out of a small two-shelf bookshelf can possible get something larger, more secure and safer for your books.",S√≠,1222,1222,0

Ive recently gotten really into anime and manga, but my parents dont really like this and judge me for it üôÑ And recently my parents discovered my manga collection.  
I have 3 of the Berserk deluxe, a bit of Nana, and all of Banana Fish.  
And my parents went through berserk and now are pretty pissed, wich is a little understandable because well its berserk. But now they want me to THROW AWAY all of my manga, even thought the others arent bad. They dont want them in the house at all. And its driving me insane trying to  reason with them because wtf would I throw away books that I love and spent a bit of money on??? They wont even let a friend hold on to them  or sell them because they dont want anyone else reading them (???) They also want me to get therapy and think im deranged for liking Berserk (wich im not.) They've also blocked the things I use to watch anime and read manga :/  
Idk I just want to rant about this and see if anyone had something similar happen to them??

UPDATE: Didn't know this would get thattt much attention. I would really like to give them to a friend but they have taken away my phone so contacting them would be difficult. I was able to give Berserk to a neighbor so thank god, but they r extremely pissed but oh well.

I hadn't yet gotten all of the shelves for my bookcase but now I can post the whole collection. One Piece is my favourite series and so my intention is to complete all of One Piece as box sets release.I want all of the supplementary books too. 

After that I placed my random books that aren't volumes just to help my books not fall over. A lot of those were older purchases or thrifting finds.

Then my volume 1 collection begins with ""a silent voice"". I will collect any manga that is a volume 1 but primarily for the series that interest me or that I've watched the anime for. A lot of these series I haven't read yet but I plan to someday! 

I also try and only focus on manga that is not based on a light novel etc and get the novel instead. I didn't do that entirely but that's mainly how I try to do it. I prefer the original release if I can find it and really don't like omnibus/viz big versions especially since those contain more than 1 volume.

I occasionally get some light novels which I put at the bottom, and my KyoAni BluRay collection is down there too.

I've been reading and collecting manga on and off since about 2005 but it really kicked off again in 2020, one small silver lining to the pandemic. 

Of the 650 books I own I've read 517 of them (approx. 80%). I've started to slow down my new buys to try and improve those numbers. 

The main culprits that remain stubbornly unread are 20th Century Boys, Demon Slayer, Goodnight Punpun, Erased & Spriggan. I'm mostly catching up with ongoing series these days and need to find time to read some completed ones. 

Right now I'm reading Sazan & Comet Girl and catching up with The Fable Vol 3 as Vol 4 was just released. Next on the list is Oshi no Ko.

I count 1 book as 1 volume, even if it is an omni or 3 in 1, so for those who count differently I have no idea how many actual vols I own across all the multi-volume books. I also dont include art books in the total. (Just counted, I have 11 art books, added a photo).

Happy collecting all. üëç

I love tragedy as well. Jun Mochizuki has my heart (Pandora Hearts for the win) and D. Gray Man is my favorite ongoing tragedy.  I will survive to its completion.

Natsume Book of Friends (favorite supernatural series), but obtaining all the singles is next to impossible. I've been a fan for a decade.

MPD Psycho used better quality, most likely acid free, paper so it hasn't yellowed much/at all. Thinking about it now the cost of printing them that way is probably part of what killed off the run before completion. 

Crying Freeman, on the other hand, is basically made with cheap recycled toilet paper grade stuff, and Mushishi isn't much better. I have recently re-read most of these manga. They are fine / in great shape considering their age and my lack of F's given. (I'm a smoker, but have no pets or children).

I guess with me buying secondhand manga or older manga that still have the $10 price tag I didn't realize that newer manga nowadays are so pricey. 
Tbh there isn't as many manga that really interest me like there used to be when I was younger, I think the only manga that interest me in stores is Imakoi, LoveSick Ellie, Last Game(only cause I read this when I was younger), The Abandoned Empress, and couple of others. I'm just still in shock at the price of 'Last Game' it's not colorized or anything but I guess that just shows how out of touch I am buying manga ü•π

Edit; I didn't think this was going to pick up so much traction, I love reading everyone stories about manga pricing though-I was never into shonen jump series so I can't say I had the pleasure of dealing with $7.99 manga since my main preference was Dark Horse, Yen Press, TokyoPop, Kodansha, and Seven Seas Entertainment.

* mostly free
* up to date to the week's chapter

* zoom
* indoor lighting is perfect

I've tried splitting and organizing with XS on the left and XL on the right, but because my XL manga vastly outnumber my XS, it looks so strange. XL will be like 2 1/2 shelves and XS will be 1 1/2. So I mixed them. Still strange, though.

Unfortunately I've sold most of what I had over the years, especially when I left home, but these have followed me around on my travels.

It's sad to think of all the volumes and series I sold off when I was younger but I'm so happy that to still have this little collection. I sold the entirety of xxxholic in my early 20's so I'm slowly building that series up again.

Most of my collection is on my kindle now, which although it doesn't have the display positive it definitely has the saving space positive üòÇ

I know that the sight of some of the sun bleach damage to some of the spines will make some of you recoil but when you're younger you sometimes don't think about the long term value of some items, atleast I didn't.

Take your time enjoying each series. In the excitement of first jumping into the manga world, you may be tempted to just snatch up box set after box set based solely off the recommendations of others. However, my biggest piece of advice would be to ease yourself into each series one or two volumes at a time. Who knows? You may end up HATING the manga that everyone else raves about.

1st sale was 2 items for ~$6.50. 2nd was cheaper, 2 items for ~$3.50. I've got most of these from the 1st, because the 2nd was just a continuation of the leftover books from the 1st.

A mix of completing, reading and new. I like Smoking Behind the Supermarket, and I'm happy to get the 1st volume. I think I last read Shaman King in the early 2000s, so this feels nostalgic.

1esefeq,Something a little different - How to Draw Manga series,2024-08-14 18:16:39,Arxanah,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1esefeq,14,"In the early 2000s, with anime and manga exploding in popularity in the US, interest in the art style naturally also increased. This led to a deluge of English-published books on how to draw manga, with many (if not most) of them being low quality efforts made simply to cash in on the latest fad.

Of these books, the How to Draw Manga series from Graphic Sha Publishing was probably one of the more popular and more respected entries in the genre, having been originally published in Japan before making its way State-side. There have been plenty of arguments over whether or not books like this are actually useful in learning how to draw, but I find them a fascinating glimpse into what was considered popular manga styles at the time, sort of like a time capsule.

So naturally, I collected every single volume of the series released in the US, as well as every volume on every side series branded with the How to Draw Manga label. It took a while to collect all the volumes because some of them are so rare nowadays, but after finally getting the last volume I was missing, I can finally show off my collection.

1e1bkw9,A statement (and update) from the founder of Kirei Cake,2024-07-12 03:24:32,nitorita,https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/1e1bkw9/a_statement_and_update_from_the_founder_of_kirei/,313,"Hi. It feels surreal to write up a thread like this as I never thought the day would actually come, but now it finally has.

I hesitated for the longest time as I prefer to keep quiet, but I believe the public deserves to know what has been happening with me, considering all of these translation delays.

In a nutshell (TL;DR), I will be downsizing operations. If you don't care for backstory, skip to the bottom.

------------------------------------------------------------

For those who may not be aware, I started translating some time in 2009 for another group. That was a very long time ago and I was still a teen back then. Just a random person who loved reading manga and wanted to contribute to the scene.

Not long after, wanting to have more autonomy, I created my own group (Kirei Cake). At the time, I couldn't think of a group name, so I just slapped together the first two words that came to mind. Kirei (which means ""pretty"" in Japanese, but everyone just thinks of the dude from Fate), and Cake (none of which was ever physically given out, so it truly was a lie xP). Eventually, it stuck and I didn't bother changing it.

The first official release was made on May 24, 2011. Just some random small series I bought a volume to, to test the waters with. It wasn't anything special. I picked up and worked on a bunch of other series shortly thereafter. (As of this May, Kirei Cake is 13 years old. Insane, I know.)

Being young and driven (and never realizing that I had ADD until literally a year ago), I spent the next decade basically becoming a mindless slave to the scene. I was addicted. Hard.

Due to my mother's poor health (which has only gradually deteriorated since then), I was forced to stay at home and take care of her all this time. I dropped out of university in my second year, and virtually never left home except for groceries. I actually couldn't, as she needed extensive caretaking almost 24/7.

There are a lot of rumours and hearsay floating around regarding her, but to keep it simple, she suffered from chronic anemia and a severe case of psychosis which prevented her from realizing that she had a health problem and was constantly in denial of it. (There are a lot more specifics to this story, but that goes beyond the scope of this thread, and I would rather not speak about it.)

In any case, I had to make do under such circumstances. Since I couldn't get a job and I couldn't leave home, eventually, I was forced to turn a hobby into an occupation, since what little rental income we had was eventually not enough to keep up with the inflation in society. I started to put the infamous note into the releases I made that you have all seen at least a hundred times by now.

The donations helped. A lot. It wasn't much (and still isn't), but it was enough to get by and cover my mother's medical costs, so I was satisfied with that. I lived modestly and saved wherever I could. My heartfelt gratitude goes to all those who have donated and are possibly continuing to do so.

As time went by, the scene went through generations of change. I never thought I'd stick around for long (and there was one point where I actually did just give up and stop), but lo and behold, here I am now. One of (if not the) oldest scanlation groups still operating to this day. (This group outlived dozens of massive, long-standing groups that have been operating for years.)

Since I had a bit of talent for the scene, I was not only able to translate, but also edit. A one-person army. And since I had copious amounts of time and was chronically addicted to the work (which was in part a bit of a coping mechanism), I'd push out a release every day or two. And this continued for years.

Many readers and other scene members came under the impression that my group was also massive due to that throughput, and it quickly became a household name. This was never really my intention, since I mostly focused on niche series that most didn't care about, but it is what it is.

I did have people come and go to help assist with the editing, and for a short time, the translating as well. I am genuinely grateful to all of those members for volunteering their time and effort to help. Many of them were young like me and just wanted something to do during their adolescence or young adulthood and wanted to help speed up releases.

Things became efficient, and pushing out several releases a day wasn't uncommon during the group's heyday. Unfortunately, this only served to further steer the group's reputation into a direction that would ultimately become its Achilles heel.

Because people would think that our group was massive and getting along well with chapters being pushed out daily, nobody new wanted to join in and volunteer their help. This eventually led to stagnant periods, where releases would take longer to be pushed out. And the delays only kept getting longer. I tried to juggle around the dozens of series we had to keep them all refreshed and to give their readers at least something to read every once in a while.

Fast forward to roughly COVID, and the group has reached a point where it's basically only me and maybe 1-2 other people occasionally helping out. Everyone else has either gotten a job/gone to school/moved on/etc. This was still okay for the most part‚Äîsince I could do everything myself anyway, making releases was only a matter of when, not if. And most readers didn't really seem to mind.

Fast forward to about two years ago, and I somehow landed a relationship and got married. It was sudden and happened fast. I won't go into too many details about the relationship, but in terms of what is pertinent, my SO increasingly wants more time for us to bond, and translation is getting in the way.

For a while, I tried to schedule things and make it work, but it doesn't seem to be working out, and my ADD isn't helping either as I keep making stupid decisions in the relationship that only serves to cause strife. I really needed to downsize, and my pride wasn't letting me. But I've finally bit the bullet, and here I am now.

------------------------------------------------------------

As of this thread's posting, the following series are hereby dropped and free for anyone to pick up:

- [Adventurer License](https://mangadex.org/title/26dd4eae-1bf7-4834-986b-40914cbd5816/boukensha-license-wo-hakudatsu-sareta-ossan-dakedo-manamusume-ga-dekita-no-de-nonbiri-jinsei-wo) - A cute story that I would've liked to see through, but I could never make time for.
- [Assassin Aristocrat](https://mangadex.org/title/b49fd121-19bf-4344-a8e1-d1be7ca04e08/sekai-saikyou-no-assassin-isekai-kizoku-ni-tensei-suru) - The story derailed quite a while back, so not much of a loss. And it seems someone has recently picked this up.
- [Black Mage](https://mangadex.org/title/c26a8a56-7fa6-4efd-93a1-5289c36c3634/welcome-to-the-impregnable-demon-king-castle-the-black-mage-who-got-kicked-out-of-the-hero-party-due) - This series isn't difficult to translate, but I'm having trouble juggling it with the rest of the series I am currently focusing on.
- [Devil Wife](https://mangadex.org/title/a990e445-7a43-454b-a062-ab34492f1308/negai-wo-kanaete-moraou-to-akuma-wo-shoukan-shitakedo-kawaikattanode-kekkonshimashita-akuma-no) - This series involves a lot of editing, and chapters are long. Since it has already (IMO) reached its peak and I do not realistically have the capacity to work on it, I'll be letting it go.
- [Misfit Quartet](https://mangadex.org/title/a9e23d07-b293-4530-b592-e97880c8101f/the-chronicles-of-the-misfit-quartet-and-their-unrivaled-synergy) - A real shame, because I liked this and thought it had a lot of potential.
- [Returned Hero](https://mangadex.org/title/69dcebee-7446-4eb2-8244-d903f12a6712/the-modern-strongest-hero-who-came-home) - Was always a meme series, but the ridiculously slow publishing speed is just silly.
- [Sweet Dreams in the Demon Castle](https://mangadex.org/title/7c418a1c-9241-451e-995a-31f673b4340a) - Despite working on this for years, it's time to let go since it'll never end. And it seems VIZ is actively working on this and is already far ahead.
- [Until Your Sword Breaks](https://mangadex.org/title/e65ab2ca-158d-43d9-8933-9afa17d117ff/until-your-sword-breaks) - Not quite as good as the Duke of Death though and doesn't really give off the same vibes. I have since handed this off to another group, who kindly came to request picking it up from me.

The following series will remain low priority, and chapters will be released sporadically whenever I have the time to work on them:

- [Darwin's Game](https://mangadex.org/title/8466/darwin-s-game) - There's only a few chapters left (it's a finished series), but I haven't had any time to work on them. I do plan to eventually finish it off, though.
- [Decade Legend](https://mangadex.org/title/66f42f5f-bcb7-437b-9ae5-752c84bce709/koko-wa-ore-ni-makasete-saki-ni-ike-to-itte-kara-10-nen-ga-tattara-densetsu-ni-natte-ita) - I quite like this series and I want to work on it regularly, so it's more like mid-priority. Editing assistance would be highly appreciated.

The following series are high priority and are being actively worked on. They will be caught up with ASAP, so do not worry about them:

- [Dai Dark](https://mangadex.org/title/84703c86-eb83-45ec-8fc5-f34a25115893) - Up to date.
- [Dark Massacre](https://mangadex.org/title/bd38c075-8b12-450a-aeee-125e3ac5da4b) - Only a few chapters behind. Will release multiple chapters at once every so often.
- [Death Flags](https://mangadex.org/title/16dcfceb-4382-45f1-adb0-d57fc5ea0d06) - Same situation as Dai Dark.
- [Former World #1](https://mangadex.org/title/4754fc66-6bcb-4cc3-98ec-10f585cc55f3) - Encountering some hiccups here and there, but I'm gradually catching up with it. Help with editing would be highly appreciated.
- [Frieren at the Funeral](https://mangadex.org/title/b0b721ff-c388-4486-aa0f-c2b0bb321512/sousou-no-frieren) - Need not be said. I still release same-day and have been doing so since the series began.

- [Yakuza Reincarnation](https://mangadex.org/title/7cd3ca23-2d70-4c03-99f0-b1ee848c4dc4/yakuza-reincarnation) - I personally enjoy this series and will do my best to catch up to the latest chapter as soon as possible.

I believe that covers all of the series that I currently translate, but if I missed some, please ask. I may have just forgotten about it.

I will answer inquiries made here, but only if they pertain to translation. I do not wish to answer any questions regarding my personal life at this time.",S√≠,4625,4625,0

1dyxz34,Onani Master Kurosawa is one of the best mangas I have ever read. (A short paragraph thing),2024-07-09 05:17:07,MeguminIncognitoAcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/1dyxz34/onani_master_kurosawa_is_one_of_the_best_mangas_i/,130,"A very poetic and amazingly well written story with coming-of-age themes and adapted from a light novel, Onani Master Kurosawa... Is about **a middle school guy masturbating (Onani). Every day.**  
He always does it once every day in the girl's bathroom on the 3rd floor of the 1st school building whilst fantasizing about one of the many girls in his school.  
Now I know this may sound like a horrible premise for a story to you, and trust me, it kind of is, but this series was an absolute rollercoaster ride of emotions and will most definitely be pulling at your heart strings and on top of that there is character development, consequences, and ATONEMENT.

So if you don't mind a little bit of semen here's the [MD link](https://mangadex.org/title/7b88e8d3-d2a9-4fe8-be55-44ccfbd8f700/onani-master-kurosawa), please give it a try. Trust me you (probably) won't regret it. It's not really NSFW besides the fact that... the MC jacks off a lot. (Always off camera)

1epl4xd,I finally realised what's wrong with My Hero Academia,2024-08-11 09:44:18,Jack_KH,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1epl4xd/i_finally_realised_whats_wrong_with_my_hero/,847,"While watching season 7, I started to think about what went wrong with MHA. It was so popular before, but now everyone remembered it existed only because the manga ended. I came up with a few reasons why.

1. After Allmight vs All for One fight almost nothing interesting happened for 5 cours. The hypest thing during this period is Endevour vs Nomu and it's not much. I think this is the main reason why the franchise went into such a numb state. Now, with season 6 and 7 things get better, but it will never reach heights it had during seasons 2 and 3.

The reason for this is that the show tries to combine shonen action with slice of life and fails to do so. So many training arcs, exams and festivals, it's insane. It would've been OK if the time was spent on developing characters, but no. Ida becomes useless after season 2, Ochaco is a lazy ""will they, won't they"" girl, and I would've gotten rid of at least a third of 1A students.

2) The show tries to be important, like it's talking about serious social issues with the hero society, but it never dives deep into topics it raises. They either come out of nowhere, or dissapear into nothing, or both. For example, it is revealed that not heroes are not allowed to use quirks freely, hense Meta Liberation Army. But what kiinds of regulations are there? We saw Deku's mother use her quirk in the hospital once, so what's the problem? You're saying that the government uses hitmen to make inconvenient people disappear? We're just gonna ignore that. Also, recently it was said that those who don't look like humans are being oppressed and they see Spinner as their revolutionary symbol. Hovewer, we have never seen that. There are heroes that are not humanoid, they have government positions. There was this one time where a group of people bullied a fox girl, but a) this is not enough, b) it was an example of how an aggressive mob tries to take justice in their own hands, so this is a completely different topic.

And yeah, about that. This is the only theme with which the show goes all the way. After the failure of heroes in the first war, people got tired of living in fear and decided to hunt villians themselves. This is shown as a wrong thing, even tho it's heroes' fault for not doing their job well they're paid for. There were a couple of interviews and press conferences where heroes are asked about why they haven't dealt with the villian problem yet and it was shown as they are ignorant normies, not valuing what heroes are going through and just demanding. When smallfolks are revolting, there are making things worse: just let the big boys solve the problem.

Overall, MHA wants to make its world full of problems and injustice, but still wants to keep the happy facade. The whole show feels like if the privileged and rich find out that there are first world problems and some people don't have second houses. They're like: ""Oh no, this is so bad, this is so sad. If only there was something we could do...but what exactly? Oh, man, whatever"" and then moved on. Only people with useful quirks are allowed to be heroes and the rest goes to Support and Management? Well, only Shinso gets his chance, we are not going to change the system.

2.5) A separated problem is with Stain. It's funny that people think that his ideals have value and are realistic. In a world where almost everyone has superpowers, no one is going to risk their lives for free, out of heroic impulse. In comic books like Superman and Spider-Man, the hero is usually the only one with powers and therfore it's easy for them to stop another robbery. But in MHA, heroes are fighting against quirked people. How do you expect people to be altruistic and patrol the streets, looking for criminals to subdue them? Plus, and this is important, we haven't seen a single corrupt or irresponsible hero. There are heroes who care about their image, like Uwabami, hovewer, when they are needed, they do their job. So, what is Stain's problem?

3) The last problem is the writing during action. Every fight goes like this:

Villian: ""You didn't know this, hero, but all along I was right"" \*punches hero\*

Hero: ""You think you are right. But you are wrong, because you are wrong. The one who is right is ME!"" \*punches harder\*

It's just so dull. There are no fights, they are only characters verbally explaining their morals and motivations. It's supposed to be epic, hype, emotional, but actually comes out as ridiculous and repetitive. Like when Lemillion said to Shigaraki that he needs to have some friends. It was funny.

In summary, MHA is a very uneven show, that tries to fly too close to the Sun.",S√≠,4003,4003,0

1g94v9u,Dandadan: A Brief Explanation of the Takakura Ken Joke [Dandadan episode 1 spoilers],2024-10-21 21:08:15,RPO777,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1g94v9u/dandadan_a_brief_explanation_of_the_takakura_ken/,188,"There's a joke based around the name of the male MC of Dandadan being ""Takakura Ken"" that probably lands a lot harder for Japanese audiences familiar with the super-famous actor than Western audiences who likely don't know who he is.  So this is a brief explanation of who Takakura Ken is, and why the last few minutes of episode 1 of Dandadan are an elaborate joke around that actor's name.

[Takakura Ken \(Explosion\)](https://preview.redd.it/3a3qamfa67wd1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e000033ee958d9474022f93e82bbb8a1153618)

Dandadan quickly establishes in the opening moments of the anime that Momo is a huge Takakura Ken fan, to the point where she started dating an obviously not particularly great guy simply because his looks reminded her of her beloved Ken-san (who she takes a roundhouse kick at in the opening moments of the anime).

Takakura Ken is (1931-2014) is an immensely famous Japanese actor,  He won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Actor four times, the most in Japanese Cinema history.  He starred in over 200 films.  He was also a hit singer that appeared frequently in Japan's prestigious New Years Kohaku Utagassen singing show, and was a frequent presence in Japanese commercials from the 60s onward.

He was extremely famous for his stoic persona, where he would almost invariable play a strong-silent type of guy, who is always a gentleman, doesn't show overt interest in women, but is focused on his craft and has difficulty expressing his emotions.

Ken-san's signature line actually comes from a commercial he did that ran for decades starting in the 1980s, where in selling life insurance he says ""Bukiyou desukara"" (I'm an awkward fellow).  The unspoken (and obvious to Japanese audiences) idea being ken-san struggles to show how much he cares about his loved ones, but he'll follow through with his actions and make sure they have the life insurance protection they need.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0emcxNiEbp8&t=15s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0emcxNiEbp8&t=15s)

Ken-san is as famous and iconic to Japanese people as like say, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, or Robert De Niro.  The name instantly conjures up a certain rough, tough, stoic image of a character with a certain distinctive type of charm.

So the last few minutes of episode 1 actually demonstrate how although the male MC doesn't LOOK like Takakura Ken, he's actually WAY more like what Momo likes about Takakura Ken the actor than her ex-BF.

1. he bravely goes off to fight Turbo Granny alone because he feels responsible for himself and doesn't want to endanger Momo.
2. He has trouble expressing his emotions, being the quiet type.
3. He uses Takakura Ken's tagline ""Bukyou Desukara"" (I'm an awkward fellow)
4. He is a gentleman and shows discomfort (rather than interest) at Momo being in a state of undress, and asks her to put on some clothes since he can't talk to her in that state.

As Momo unconsciously realizes how much the MC is like her beloved Ken-san her heart picks up audibly, and she tries to laugh and play it off, asking him what his name is to distract herself from her own realization.

Then the joke is that improbably, the name of the MC turns out to be... Takakura Ken (explosion).",S√≠,3876,3876,0

1f24bj2,Tower of God's anime adaptation is an utter dissapointment and a spit in the face to the author and every fan,2024-08-26 20:52:42,the25thalex,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1f24bj2/tower_of_gods_anime_adaptation_is_an_utter/,537,"I'm not going to cope or be persuaded. From the moment the first trailer of season 2 dropped, I knew it was going to be very subpar at best. They have managed to change or more often than not, completely cut basically every single cool panel. No tension, no meaningful direction, rushed through script. I could go on forever but this shit is a joke and a series of this caliber should never deserve this kind of treatment. This series has some unbelievable ass shit in it, not that the anime would ever do any ounce of it justice ofcourse. Thoughts? Side note. I highly suggest reading the webtoon from stleast the start of season 2 if your interested. It's a completely different experience. Overall, it's an amazing series and I hate the fact that so many people are going to watch season 1 or two and drop it thinking that the series is shit rather than the adaptation itself. BTW if ur interested you can read it completely for free on webtoon. Without making an account too. If anyone has any questions about the webtoon please ask.",S√≠,3297,3297,0

Episode 7 goes over the backstory of Acrobatic Silky, who at first glance seemed like just another monster of the week for our protagonist's to face quickly delves into a hard-hitting backstory showcasing a single mother trying her best to raise her daughter the best she can. 

I won't go much into the details since that's not the point of my discussion. What caught my attention was how they crafted this entire sequence with very minimal dialogue yet it works, it worked beautifully. It was visual storytelling at its best. 

Episodes like this is why I prefer anime over manga. This is why I love the medium of animation in general. It's not everyday that we get this kinda episodes but when we do get one it leaves a mark.",S√≠,2996,2996,0

1erzjvj,86 is a masterpiece,2024-08-14 07:49:45,LastExtent3337,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1erzjvj/86_is_a_masterpiece/,511,"So I just finished watching 86, and God damn this show was a masterpiece. It was a rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish, and the ending of season 2 was perfect. Idk if we're getting a third season, but i would be perfectly happy if it is left like this.

 Imo in my anime rankings, its higher than Demon Slayer (a hot take given the die hard demon slayer fandom). 

Honestly people who haven't watched this **need** to watch it, and if you have, what are your thoughts on it?

EDIT: 

So as a lot of you have pointed out, masterpiece may be too strong a word, however I would say that amongst many modern anime that are boring or just plain trash, 86 is a breath of fresh air. I do believe it‚Äôs an outstanding anime, and the word masterpiece is obviously subjective. Some of you guys might hold the term to a higher standard than I do. Some anime like HxH or Aot or DBZ may be considered to be better, but just because I‚Äôm calling 86 a masterpiece, doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that they are too.

 Thanks to all of you for respecting my opinion so far. I do read all of your replies even if it would be impossible for me to reply to them all. Enjoy contributing to the discussion!",S√≠,2574,2574,0

I can't get the events out of my head tbh. I started binging the series just a week ago and this was the episode I caught up on, so everything is still fresh. I feel like I got too immersed in the show to affect me severely. 

I don't know if it's a coincidence but damn they're absolutely diabolical for that one. Devious mfs. 

Now I have to binge another anime to keep my mind away from the meantime but I don't know what yet. 

Would like your help in this one, thanks!

To my surprise, 80-90% of the Top Japanese comments on [the Main Trailer](https://youtu.be/4XhXF-xVtok?si=YC2aPaIwTqObyGmU) and [Trailer 2](https://youtu.be/CdnMoPIgC5s?si=vhu6qcNkT81GvoNT) are all negative. Especially on Trailer 2. Even the character introduction shorts they released [had a very negative reception in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/SakamotoDays/comments/1gcdo7f/damn_japanese_ppl_are_really_not_vibing_with_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). On the official TMS YouTube channel, it got soo bad to the point TMS started removing comments.

Some Japanese comments under the Main Trailer(Machine Translation) -

* It's bad to have people worry about the animation in a PV...(653 likes)
* I'm looking forward to it, but when I think about the animation and the voice actors of my favorite characters, I feel a little sad. (571 likes)
* the animation is not that bad, but the battle scenes in the original are so amazing that it just looks soo much inferior. (502 likes)
* As a reader of the original work, I was hoping for something less flat and more fast-paced... Even if it didn't sell well and they made the Order Arc, I'd imagine the animation would be the same... (348 likes)
* This is a picture that lacks any sense of tension. Wouldn't it have been better to make it a bit darker overall? (136 likes)
* It's sad that Sakamoto, a candidate for Jump's next flagship, is being consumed like this as an average anime Not only is the art bad, but the voice actors are not a good fit either, and I've been looking forward to it being made into an anime for a long time, so the disappointment is huge... It's a work that could carry Jump in the future, so I wish they'd taken better care of it. (110 likes)
* I wanted Bones to make it... (180 likes)

Some Japanese comments from Trailer 2 (Machine Translation) -

* I thought the action in the manga was so good it would be good as an anime... (237 likes)
* A rare animated work that is likely to become popular is a still image. (394 likes)
* It's a candidate for Jump's flagship series. So this is the most important anime adaptation for that. Why did they leave it to TMS? (138 likes)
* deleting negative comments does not change the fact that people are not happy with how TMS and Shueisha is handling one of its top series. You are just making the fans angrier. (English comment) (147 likes)
* This manga, whose selling point is its dynamic and powerful action, can be made into an anime with this kind of artwork...? (145 likes)
* Why does something like this happen to Lupin when the animation quality is so high? Well, there are a ton of other issues before that. (181 likes)
* I'm a bit worried that there aren't any action scenes in the PV. (752 likes)
* Is this kind of behavior acceptable? If I were the original author, I'd cry. (158 likes)

I dont remember the last time an upcoming anime got this much hate even before it started airing. I personally think anime [looks decent](https://www.reddit.com/r/SakamotoDays/comments/1hmrgn1/all_well_animated_cuts_from_all_the_trailers_we/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), its not as bad as ppl are saying but its interesting to see soo much backlash from japanese side of things. I wonder if this much backlash will change anything, like how Ryu Nakayama left CSM anime after the backlash he got from Japanese side.

Edit - even the comments under [the Official Shonen Jump channel](https://youtu.be/B9Qr2XmP2Ss?si=i6vpd5QLQSf36RsU) are also all negative",S√≠,2172,2172,0

1duqnqi,"Please, get comfortable with dropping anime you are not enjoying",2024-07-03 18:05:56,Sin778,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1duqnqi/please_get_comfortable_with_dropping_anime_you/,705,">""When does this show get better?""

If you spend any time on this sub and dare to venture into the ""new"" tab, you see 5 of these posts every time you open reddit.

>""I never drop any anime. If I start something, I have to finish it.""

The amount of times I have seen this exact sentiment is genuinly baffling to me.

Please, for the love of god, instead of wasting your time on watching something you don¬¥t find fun or arguing over wether it gets better on reddit, get comfortable to make the decision to stop watching something, no matter if its a highly acclaimed show or not. Trust yourself.

When someone says ""just keep watching, it gets better"" about a show you dislike, most of the time the better stuff won¬¥t do it for you either. When people say it ""gets better"", what that usually means is ""it will be more of the same, but better"", but what you want to hear is ""it gets good in a different way"". It gets better holds true for people who are already fans, but for someone who is not enjoying it, 9/10 times, nothing will change.

But then, what about that one time out of 10 where it would? The reality of it is, there is such a huge amount of great anime, you will never to be able to come close to watching all of them. Even if you never drop a single anime to never miss anything good, it¬¥s still not going to change that. If anything, the time you waste watching shows you don¬¥t enjoy in hopes of it ""getting better"" is time you could spend watching something that you actually like.

If you feel ""this show is not worth watching"", trust yourself, and drop the anime. There are too many great anime out there to spend your time watching something you don¬¥t want to.

You will also not feel the same about every show at every point in time. While, for me, it hasn¬¥t happened a lot that a show actually ""got better"", what has happened a lot is that I went back to a show after a few months or years and found that I felt totally different about it. Over time your taste changes, and shows that didn¬¥t click with you before might do so in the future. A show won¬¥t suddenly disappear if you decide to put it down today.

If you feel ""this show just doesn¬¥t click with me"", trust yourself, and drop the anime. Should you ever feel like it, you can pick it back up at any point in the future.

Not everyone likes the same things. It does not matter if the show you are watching is a popular and highly acclaimed, if you are not enjoying your time with it, it doesn¬¥t matter how many people feel otherwise. When it comes to enjoying a show, no one is right or wrong. They aren¬¥t wrong for liking a show you dislike, and you aren¬¥t wrong for disliking a show they like. You don¬¥t have to agonize over not liking a show because a lot of others did.

If you feel ""this show is so popular, I must be missing something"", trust yourself, and drop the anime. In the end, other peoples experiences with a show have no influence on yours.

What a lot of people seemingly tend to forget is that watching anime is not a job, it¬¥s a hobby. There are no shows you are required to watch, there are no shows you are required to like, and there is no required way on how to engage with the medium of anime. You don¬¥t want to watch something? Great, then don¬¥t, you are not watching anime to please other people, are you?

By no means do I want you to take this as ""never step out of your comfort zone, just watch what you know you¬¥ll like"", though. Exactly the opposite, actually. Go explore and try as many different shows as possible. If you¬¥re not into the show you started? Drop it, move on. You don¬¥t need everyones permission to drop a show you do not feel is worth your time. Inevitably, you¬¥ll find a show that you never knew you would like. A show that you would have never found if you were afraid of starting new show because you see it as too big of a commitement.

You can only find new shows you¬¥ll enjoy if you actually start them, and you can only get to shows you¬¥ll enjoy if you drop the ones you don¬¥t.

Edit: 

Some people seem to take this post as me saying everyone should just drop any show they are watching for any reason other than the literal enjoyment of it, or everyone should just drop any show that doesn¬¥t have a perfect 10/10 beginning, so let me clarify: 

Different people will watch different shows for different reasons. Wether you want to watch a genuinly good show, or you want to hate-watch a bad show, or you want to finish a show to write a critical review of it, or you want to expand your understanding of what makes stories good or bad by watching something even if you don¬¥t necessarly enjoy the product itself, all of that is great. You know what you want out of the show, so you¬¥re getting some sort of value from it, even if that value isn¬¥t the same value the creators were orginally intending. Nowhere do I say that those people should for some reason drop these shows. None of these people are the ones who make ""I watched 10 episodes of this show and don¬¥t like it, should I drop this show?"" posts. 

Sometimes shows with mediocre starts get better later on. If a show has a flawed beginning, but you still see aspects that promise something of value, then sure, it might be worth to keep going for a little while longer. Even a flawed story can still hold some great things. But if you genuinly dislike what you are watching? Unless the show genuinly somehow turns into a different story, no amount of improvement will change anything for you. 

My point is, if you are watching a show, and you aren¬¥t getting any sort of value from it, whatever that may mean for you, and the only reason you are still watching is the hope that the show magically gets better, it¬¥s fine to use your own judgement of ""I¬¥m not getting anything out of investing my time in this"", and drop the show.",S√≠,2158,2158,0

I haven't checked any other languages or any other platforms.

In the current age of AI hysteria and localizer drama, with machine translation being sometimes used by publishers to rush badly translated manga and visual novels to the market, many people were quick to claim that the official, dreadful subs for My Deer Friend Nokotan/Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan on Crunchyroll were made by an ""AI"".

This cannot be further from the truth. Every mistake points to a not very competent human translator, who was also not given enough time to proofread their work. **Lack of time and lack of editing are the main culprits behind the quality of the subtitles. Not the spooky AI.**

Here are the examples that almost never happen if you use an automated tool:

>[JA] ‰∏çÂãïÊòéÁéãÊßò„ÅÆÂ∫≠„Å´ÈõÜ„ÅÜ‰πôÂ•≥„Åü„Å°„Åå‰ªäÊó•„ÇÇÊñ∞Êí∞ÁµÑÈöäÂ£´„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™ÁÑ°Âû¢„Å™Á¨ëÈ°î„ÅßÁéâÂ∑ù„ÅÆÊµÅ„Çå„ÇíË∂Ö„Åà„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åè„ÄÇ

>[EN] Once again, today, the maidens who gather in the gardens of the wisdom king cross the tama river with smiles as pure as those of the shinsengumi troopers.

Comparison with actual MTL:

>[Google] The young girls who gather in the garden of Acala Buddha statue today too cross the Tamagawa River with innocent smiles like Shinsengumi soldiers.

>[DeepL] The maidens who gather in the garden of Fudo Myoo-sama cross the Tamagawa stream with innocent smiles like Shinsengumi troopers today.

Note the following:

* MTL calls the river Tamagawa, not Tama

* MTL uses proper capitalization. It's humans who are more likely to fail to capitalize words, not computers. It's very likely that the translator was rushing and hoped that they (or the editors) fix all the capitalization later. *There was no ""later"".*

* MTL keeps the proper name of [Acala/Fud≈ç My≈ç-≈ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acala) instead of replacing it with a localized title

It seems that this sentence was translated by someone with good knowledge of Japanese culture, but with not a great feel for translation.

>[JA] „ÇÇ„ÅÜ„Åæ„Å†„Åæ„Å†ÂØí„ÅÑ„Å™„ÅÅ

>[EN] It‚Äôs still so coooold!

This is not a bad translation, but MTL would never prolong vowels like this.

>[EN] Erm‚Ä¶ Thank you very much!

This is subtle, but notice that this sentence does not contain three periods, it contains a single ellipsis character. Now that's weird, why does it? Neither MTL's nor most humans use it. There are two possible answers: either automatic character substitution in Word, or someone using a non-standard keyboard layout/input method and preferring to type an ellipsis. For example, the standard Japanese input method. Anyhow, still slightly more likely that a human did it.

>[EN] Are you kidding me? We have a suicideby hanging right in the first episode?!

A missing space. MTL almost never omit spaces, humans omit spaces all the time.

>[JA] Ë≠¶ÂØüÔºüÂåªËÄÖÔºü„Åì„Éª„Éª„Åè„ÇìÔºü„Åò„ÇÉ„Å™„ÅÑÔºÅ„ÅØ„Åò„ÇÅ„Å°„ÇÉ„ÇìÔºÅ

>[EN] Should I call the police? a doctor? Detective Co... No, Hajimeeeee!

(I'm not sure about the Japanese text, I guessed what it was based on the translation. Yes, the dots are what I guessed, it's the typical trademark censorship. This line, as many others, is anime-original, so I couldn't cross-reference it with manga.)

First, again, we see a prolonged vowel here. Second, a reference to Detective Conan could not be guessed by MTL, it had to be done by a human who guessed (correctly or not) the intention of the script writer.

Also, arguably missing or inconsistent capitalization. Most style guides would capitalize the ""a"", and MTL also capitalizes it.

>[JA] Êù±‰∫¨„Åò„ÇÉ„Å™„ÅÑ„ÄÅÂçÉËëâ„ÅÆ„Éç„Ç∫„Éü„Å™„Çì„Åü„ÇâÂ£≤„Å£„Å¶„Çã„ÅÇ„Çå„Åã„Å£„Å¶

>[EN] Ah, that must be those things they sell at Toky, no, Chiba mo useland‚Ä¶

First of all, we see a misspelt Tokyo. Say one thing of computers, but they at least know how to spell one of the largest cities in the world. I'm not sure if it's a typo, or a bad attempt at interrupting the word in the middle of the syllable, but again, it's not something an MTL would do.

Second, we have ""mo useland"". Given the context, it's supposed to be ""Mouseland"", a trademark-safe reference to Tokyo Disneyland (which is actually located in Chiba). Again, bad capitalization, erroneous extra space, not something a computer would do. 

But most importantly, a computer would understand „Éç„Ç∫„Éü as a literal ""mouse"" or ""rat"" and would translate it to something like this:

>[Google] It's not Tokyo, it's the one selling rats in Chiba

>[DeepL] Not in Tokyo, but in Chiba, where they sell rat poison.

Proper capitalization, proper punctuation, proper spaces, no typos, but completely nonsensical.

>[JA] Ê∞óÊ∏©12Â∫¶

>[EN] Temperature: 53.6 ¬∞f

This one is obviously human-made, MTL doesn't convert units and then misspell them.

>[JA] „Åπ„ÄÅ„Åπ„ÄÅ„Åπ„ÄÅÂà•„Å´Ë¶ãÊç®„Å¶„Çã„Çè„Åë„Åò„ÇÉ

>[EN] N-n-n-n-no, of course not, I‚Äôd never‚Ä¶

A repeated letter, again a human-like feature. And again, a single-character ellipsis.

>[JA] „Åò„ÇÉ„ÅÇ„ÄÅ„É§„É≥„Ç≠„Éº„ÅÆ„Åä„Å≠‚Äï

>[EN] Well, I‚Äôm stuck with Miss delinq...

A clipped word, something that MTL wouldn't do.

Also, ""I'm stuck with"" is not explicitly present in the original, it had to be inferred and added by a human.

>[EN] I couldn have done it without you,

An obvious human-like typo.

>[EN] Jeez, you‚Äôre going to make me do this every club meeting, arent you?

An obvious human-like typo.

EDIT: /u/alwayslonesome posted another list of examples that strongly suggest it's a human, mostly focusing on context awareness and good judgement of the translator:

https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1dy6mi6/why_the_official_subs_for_my_deer_friend/lc75oar/

---

Okay, enough bullying the English translator, let's bully the other ones.

>[DE] (‚ÄûHirsch‚Äú is the german word for a male deer so this paragraph doesn¬¥t make sense and can be removed)

Yes, the German sub contains a note in English left by a translator, hoping an editor makes the final decision and edits the line for readability, or at least comes back with some feedback.

Little did they know, _there was no editor_.

>[JA] „Åä„Åæ‚Äï„ÄÅ„Çì„Å£„ÄÅ„Çì„Çì„Å£„ÄÅ„Çì„Çì„Å£

>[EN] Hey, Y... H, hmm,

>[DE] Hey, Y... H, hm,

>[FR] H√©, Y... H, euh,

>[ES] ¬°Eres una...!

Both German and French translators translated from English and failed to notice that ""Y"" is actually a clipping of ""you"", which is probably because the English translator incorrectly capitalized it. Maybe they thought it was a clipping of a name? But note they both translated the ""hmm"".

The Spanish translator didn't. Looks like an independent translation, and I think it's a better one.

>[FR] Temp√©rature : 12 ¬∞C

>[DE] Temperatur: 12 ¬∞C

>[ES] Hay 12 grados celsius.

Given how it seems like they're based on the English translation, it looks like both German and French translators converted the units back. Something a human would do.

Spanish translation is more idiomatic, but fails to capitalize ""Celsius"". A typical human mistake.

>[DE] Meine dunkle Vergangenheit als Raufboldin,wurde von zu viel Shonen-Manga beeinflusst!

Random incorrect comma instead of space, without a space after it. MTL almost never forgets spaces after punctuation, it must have been the middle finger hitting the wrong key. Especially likely as the index finger has just struck N.  

>[JA]  ‰∏çÂãïÊòéÁéãÊßò„ÅÆÂ∫≠„Å´ÈõÜ„ÅÜ‰πôÂ•≥„Åü„Å°„Åå

>[ES] Las se√±oritas que se re√∫nen en el jard√≠n la estatua del guerrero Budista,

While the English translation used the term ""wisdom king"" (the title of Acala) and the German and French parroted it blindly, Spanish translation seems to have been made separately and translates it to a ""Buddhist warrior"". Did the translator attempt to do some research and saw that Acala is often portrayed with a sword?

---

##Conclusion:

From what I've seen, I guess what happened was this:

* English translation was most likely done in Japan in a hurry by a native Japanese speaker.

* French and German translations were based on the English translation. Also in a hurry.

* Spanish translation was most likely independent. At a first glance it looks much better than the English one.

* **There were most likely no editors involved.**

* All egregious mistakes were due to a human, mostly the English translator, but most importantly, even more **due to the managers** who didn't care about the quality of the final product.

---

Of course , one might ask, what a bad MTL translation looks like, so you know what to look for. Here are some examples from the episode:

(EDIT: Or just see what The Yuzuki Family‚Äôs Four Sons originally looked like: https://x.com/shoujocrave/status/1710022370532970702 )

>[JA] ‰∏çÂãïÊòéÁéãÊßò„ÅÆÂ∫≠„Å´ÈõÜ„ÅÜ‰πôÂ•≥„Åü„Å°„Åå„ÄÅ‰ªäÊó•„ÇÇÊñ∞Êí∞ÁµÑÂ§ß‰Ωø„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™ÁÑ°Âû¢„Å™Á¨ëÈ°î„Åß„ÄÅÁéâÂ∑ù„ÅÆÊµÅ„Çå„ÇíË∂Ö„Åà„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åè„ÄÇ

>[Google] The young girls who gather in the garden of Acala Buddha statue today too are **sailing** across the Tamagawa River with innocent smiles like Shinsengumi ambassadors.

Correct punctuation, correct capitalization, no typos, proper names preserved, but Google chose a nonsensical word in this context: ""sailing"".

(EDIT: the example above keeps my mistake of using Â§ß‰Ωø ""ambassador"" instead of its homophone ÈöäÂ£´ ""trooper"", for some reason, according to Google troopers no longer sail, but what's important is that Google _may_ use the word ""sail"" for no reason.)

>[JA] ÁßÅ„ÅØÈπøÈÉ®„ÅÆÊâÄÊúâ„ÅÆÈπø„Å´„Å™„Çã„Çè„Åë„Å†„Åã„Çâ„ÄÇ

>[Google] After all, I will become a deer owned by the Shikabu.

>[DeepL] So I would be a deer owned by the deer department.

Google fails to understand what a deer club is. Official subs use the correct term ""deer club"" and even capitalize it from time to time.

>[JA] ÂàÜ„Åã„Å£„Åü„Çà„É§„É≥„Ç≠„Éº„ÅÆ„ÅäÂßâ„Åï„Çì„ÄÇ

>[Google] I get it, Yankee lady.

>[DeepL] All right, Yankee sister.

Both tools misunderstand slang.

So as you can see, the types of mistakes are different. Other types of mistakes I often see with machine-translated Japanese are:

* translating proper names

* guessing incorrect readings for names

* confusing who speaks to whom

* confusing genders

* misunderstood puns and references

* confusion with hiragana-heavy text

They may also happen with human translators, but much less often.",S√≠,2086,2086,0

""Even the staff haven't seen it yet."" Looking back on the production, he said, ""It was just extremely tough days... It felt like I was doing a hard triathlon. Every day was so thrilling, and it's only just finished... It's still too soon to have ended, so it doesn't feel like it's over yet, so I thought that having everyone see it today would finally make me feel like it's over,"" he said with a wry smile. ""I was drawing until yesterday afternoon, and finished yesterday night. I stayed at the office all day for about two and a half months. Finally, I went home yesterday and slept in my own futon.

1egduc9,How WIT Studio changed Mikasa's Character (List of Mikasa panels that WIT Studio cut out/changed in the Attack On Titan anime),2024-07-31 00:02:51,Electrical_Chance991,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1egduc9/how_wit_studio_changed_mikasas_character_list_of/,114,"Now that the anime has ended, I decided to make a list of Mikasa stuff Wit studio cut out/changed/added. 

Also, I should say this, no offense to the studio I'm thankful for the amazing animation and the way they animated other characters but people have the right to talk about how they portrayed the FMC who has an important role in the final chapters. 

So let's start -

# The Beginning 

\- This is literally the first page of the manga. It was the first panel where Eren dreams about Mikasa saying ""See you later"" and then he wakes up crying. This ""See you later, Eren"" moment later happens when Mikasa kills Eren. Wit Studio cut this and changed this into Horror flashbacks. Mappa later adapted this in S4P3.

1fjxuhz,Now I know why Frieren has been reigning in the MAL since its run.,2024-09-18 14:00:36,Grimmer6,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1fjxuhz/now_i_know_why_frieren_has_been_reigning_in_the/,313,"I have been following the manga even before anime was announced. But I wasn't able to watch the anime during its run. Finally I got to finish the anime last night and I haven't been enthralled by an anime in a very long time. I knew the story was good but it's all thanks to Madhouse for their animation, direction and music that this show truly deserves the no. 1 spot. Tbh the story isn't the best but Madhouse made it sure that it stays to you forever. It made me crave for the series which I have been reading for years already. The subtleness in the story is what makes it different than other fantasy adventure stories. And Madhouse truly captured that subtleness. Now that the news of season 2 being in early production, I hope Madhouse does it again and not ditch the series like they used to do with tons of good shows before. ",S√≠,1651,1651,0

1h64lw6,The Japanese government is going to invest $2 million in creating an AI-driven system to detect and shut down websites involved in anime and manga piracy.,2024-12-03 22:48:28,Sometimeschill,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1h64lw6/the_japanese_government_is_going_to_invest_2/,474,"The Japanese government is backing a new and highly ambitious plan to purge online anime and manga piracy using artificial intelligence, recently announcing a new AI project worth two million dollars.

NHK reports that the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs is building an AI detection system to more effectively counter the rise of anime and manga piracy sites, allocating 300 million yen (~US$2 million) in this year's supplementary budget proposal. The system will detect images online by having the AI learn information such as the 'layout and advertisements of pirated sites' and 'images of content provided by publishers,' allowing 'rights holders to smoothly apply for the removal of detected content.'

The Japanese government's new AI tracker would follow other anti-piracy efforts, such as WEBTOON's bespoke Toon Radar technology. This embeds invisible information into webtoons to identify the source of leaks. The company has stressed its ""zero-tolerance"" approach to piracy, regularly filing subpoenas, recently suing a suspected two individuals for $700k, and announcing this week that it was responsible for closing 70 piracy sites worth 1.2 billion annual visits.

the French sub of crunchy are apparently clearly MTL, where on ADN it is correctly translated (reinforced by the fact that no translator is credited)

but there have also been Italians saying that their crunchy sub is weird whereas on Yamato Video it's good

and that must also have been the case for the English sub because many people found them weird

And I really really wanted a No Game No Life Season 2 (or Overlord S5, and S6 etc etc) And money was no issue. I waltzed into Kadokawa's top brass, and made them agree to immediately start production of whatever sequel I desired. And also remove the human limitations (X studio was full capacity working on other stuff when I made the move? Magic they get double the human resources without diminishing quality. The author/sensei behind the IP is sick or busy? Boom assume they're as healthy as a horse and not busy).

Would it guarantee the production of the anime?   
(Reason why I asked this was I just realized it had been 7 years between Overlord Season 3 and 4. And 10 for Devil is a part timer). I don't think I'm ready for another 10 years when they're sitting on so much material from the light novels.

So I was wondering, if Demand was all that was required to greenlight an anime. How much faster would we get sequels. For them to be fucking sitting on their asses.",S√≠,1442,1442,0

EDIT: YALL PLEASE READ THE PS AT THE BOTTOM IM WATCHING ONE PIECE AND IM LOVING IT

I'm trying to get into anime, and also trying to get into writing (Been wondering if I should stress myself to write book-length stories or just write shorter stories) and in my writing journey, something that has always interested me is the topic of worldbuilding.

I want to know what anime's you think have the best worldbuilding.

1hkpagg,"Not every scene with nudity or sexual implications is fanservice, yet with anime, people tend to act as that's the case.",2024-12-23 11:49:40,tyyls18,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1hkpagg/not_every_scene_with_nudity_or_sexual/,1027,"This shit really irks me. I just saw a character rant post about media that overly on SA as a means of getting a reaction, which unfairly included Dandadan, but I get why people feel that way with how the season ended.

However someone commented that both of Momo's scenes were meant for the purpose of fanservice and 
I just don't seem to understand. 

Why is any scene with nudity, or characters who wear less for example always considered fan service even with narrative reasons. How comes men being half dressed or nude doesn't equal fanservice even in the eyes of some anime fans? (Fairy Tail has 50/50 on male and female fanservice yet people solely focus on the female for whatever reason) But my biggest grievance is why does anime/manga get treated like it is done for our please more than other media which often does the same thing and even if dismissed it is really labelled as fanservice?

Edit; Reading some comments, I realised that Dandadan was definitely a poor example, but I probably have a lower standard for what constitutes as fanservice to where I might not even recognise it at first ",S√≠,1319,1319,0

He told me his favourite anime shows are overlord and redo of healer, but before you raise your eyebrow he‚Äôs 14 so he craves edgy anime no matter how depraved. So I‚Äôve been recommending him anime shows for a few months now that have good fantasy stories (which is his favourite genre) such as Frieren and eminence in shadow. He told me he liked them, so I recently recommended him Akame ga Kill which seemed right up his alley. 

A few hours later he told me he was on episode 17 which surprised me how quick he was binging through it so I assumed he was enjoying it. Eventually, I heard the final episode playing on his tv outside his room so I decided to listen in on his reaction to the ending. Only for me catch him fast forwarding through the whole episode to watch the final 5 mins before going back to watching YouTube..
I won‚Äôt be recommending anymore anime to him from now on smh ",S√≠,1257,1257,0

1dtn4za,Just finished season 1 of Mushoku Tensei after being somewhat critical of it in the past and boy was I stupid to wait this long. ,2024-07-02 10:25:47,Second_Sage,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1dtn4za/just_finished_season_1_of_mushoku_tensei_after/,883,"I‚Äôd watched two episodes back around the time it aired and it didn‚Äôt really click with me. Ended up moving on and as I got more involved in the anime community I saw the incredible amount of controversy with the series, mostly about Rudy. Thought I made the right choice dropping it and moved on. 

Fast forward to now, Frieren has left a fantasy shaped whole in my heart, and Slime just wasn‚Äôt filling it. Kept seeing the buzz around MT season 2 and figured why not give it another shot. By episode 3 or 4 I was so upset that I didn‚Äôt watch this sooner. The show was so good that I immediately felt sad that I wasn‚Äôt watching season 2 with everyone. 

There‚Äôs so much I loved about season 1 but my favourite thing has to be the character development Eris goes through.[Mushoku Tensei S1] >!The Eris you meet in her intro is completely different than the Eris that gets teleported. Then by the time they return home, she‚Äôs unrecognizable from the Eris she was.!<

Anyway if you‚Äôre on the fence like I was I suggest giving it a go, it‚Äôs become one of my favourite anime. ",S√≠,1235,1235,0

You all need lives.‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/oe5d7/30000_users_and_convention_threads/c3gjari/) \-Neito, our father who art in weebdom, circa January 12th, 2012.

Hello, one and all, to **10 million subscribers**[!](https://i.imgur.com/gc3Vs4E.png)

[10 million subscribers!](https://preview.redd.it/lhn6as07az0d1.png?width=2879&format=png&auto=webp&s=2068e3eecf34217c473a0e67d6bad120b50410c9)

Today, what began as an ordinary pet project, as a home of discussions and questions, of rankings and contests, of rewatches and writing, of strangers and friends, of mods and users, lives 16 years later as r/anime! 

Thanks to everyone who has chosen this subreddit to be a part of their anime experience. r/anime has always been a haven for people of all stripes to come together with one shared love: Japanese cartoons. Under this banner comes our love for animation, our passion for connection, and our squabbles for *Fate* watch orders. Thank you again to all 10 million subscribers for making this sub as special as the day it had only one.

Over the next couple of weeks we‚Äôll be hosting a variety of fun events: Quiz, AMQs, comment face nomination, mod AMA, Who‚Äôs Line is it Anime, and more. Let‚Äôs take a quick peek at what‚Äôs happening:

[**Saturday, May 18: Who's Line is it Anime**](https://redd.it/1cv7c8v)

It's the thread where the responses are made up and the points don't matter. That's right, we're bringing back the game from years before! Similar to the improv show [*Whose Line is it Anyway?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whose_Line_Is_It_Anyway%3F_(American_TV_series\)), it'll be an arrangement of suggestions but with themes tied to anime, so come play the past favorite of the sub.

[**Sunday, May 19: AMQ Night**](https://redd.it/1cvx9h5)

You know it, you love it, you hate it when it rolls your favorite show but you flub it with the wrong season, so come play some AMQ ([Anime Music Quiz](https://animemusicquiz.com/)) hosted by the moderators!

[**Wednesday, May 22:** r/anime**'s Favorite Anime Poll**](https://redd.it/1cyam7a)

After discovering r/anime's favorite openings, films, and tsunderes, famed chartographer /u/fetchfrosh is setting out for the Big Question: our favorite anime.

[~~Friday, May 24~~ **Tuesday, May 28th: 10 Million Subscriber Quiz (Video + Audio)**](https://redd.it/1d2yldy)

We can rebuild it. We have the technology. We can make it better than it was. Better, stronger, faster...okay, maybe not faster but the point remains, we've got a quiz combining aspects of the previous video and audio quizzes together into one spectacular bonanza!

[**Friday, May 31: Mod AMA**](https://redd.it/1d57ge9)

It's been a hot minute since we've opened an AMA up, so let's get ourselves out of our pajamas, break out the Rolodex, and start answering some questions.

[**Sunday, June 2: Niche Comment Face Nominations**](https://redd.it/1d6ad0f)

After some spring cleaning from /u/badspler, we've got a few empty spaces left open on the ole comment face cabinet. Therefore, what better way to stock it back up than with nominations from you!

It's all that and a bag of chips, so stay tuned for all of these events and more!",S√≠,1230,1230,0

1fwx0xu,Bleach has maybe the best comeback ever in the medium of anime,2024-10-05 15:32:59,mrnicegy26,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1fwx0xu/bleach_has_maybe_the_best_comeback_ever_in_the/,208,"Bleach alongside Naruto and One Piece were the defining Battle Shonens of the 2000s owing to their massive popularity and how lengthy their runs were. However while Naruto got a chance to complete its entire run by adapting the entire manga and One Piece is still running to this day, the anime adaptation of Bleach was cut short in 2012 with no promise of it ever continuing and adapting the final arc of the series.

From 2012 to 2022 we had series like Attack on Titan, One Punch Man, My Hero Academia, Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen become the defining action anime of the medium while Bleach seems to get more and more forgotten by the general audience. The only people still holding on to it were a passionate fanbase who still believed in the series enough to be hopeful that it will get a continuation even though the manga had ended so long ago.


And in 2022 Bleach finally returned after a decade and it has been a glorious comeback. It has gotten the top tier animation given to modern Shonen like Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen, completely ditched the slow pacing and abundance of fillers that plagued battle Shonen in the 2000s. Its influence can be easily seen on Black Clover, Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen. It has truly proven itself to be worthy of one of the pillars that together with Naruto and One Piece were known as the Big Three of the anime. ",S√≠,1207,1207,0
